# File Scribe 

Customise this Figma reference plugin to provide useful resources and automations for yourself or your team. Inspect the code to see how you can customise it for your own needs and publish it for your team to use. 

Follow the instructions in Josh Harwood's medium write up for this project: [Build your team a file automation plugin in Figma](https://medium.com/@noworries/building-a-figma-plugin-to-automate-your-file-setup-2094e53016ba).

Made by [@JoshDesignNZ](https://twitter.com/JoshDesignNZ) using [Create Figma Plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/).

**Contributions encouraged!**: Please feel free to suggest improvements for the plugin 🤙


## Features

This plugin template contains several automation examples, including: 

- Create document pages
- Insert a cover component with dynamic user information and date
- Insert a heading component on each page, with title and optional description
- Insert custom component(s) on specific pages
- Add links to team resources (e.g. Design System Documentation, Code repos, Comms channels)

## Installation
Instructions are based off the [quick start instructions](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/quick-start/) from [create-figma-plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin).

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NoWorries/toolkit-figma-plugin
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd toolkit-figma-plugin
```

Configuration options for your plugin go under the "figma-plugin" key of your `package.json` file.
Modify both the `name` values that you want to use for your plugin.

The `relaunchButtons` properties will insert a button in the sidebar to easily launch your plugin again.

```bash
{
  "figma-plugin": {
    "editorType": [
      "figma"
    ],
    // ...
    "name": "Design Toolkit",
    "main": "src/main.ts",
    "ui": "src/ui.tsx",
    "relaunchButtons": {
      "designToolkit": {
        "name": "Design Toolkit",
        "main": "src/main.ts",
        "ui": "src/ui.tsx"
      }
    },
  }
}
```

Build the plugin:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run watch
```

This will generate a `manifest.json` file and a build/ directory containing the JavaScript bundle(s) for the plugin.

 - [Plugin Manifest](https://figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/)
 
Configuring your plugin is done via `package.json`. Avoid manually editing the `manifest.json` file. Because the `manifest.json` file is always regenerated on build, any changes you make will always get overridden.


## Run Locally

To watch for code changes and rebuild the plugin automatically:

```bash
$ npm run watch
```

## Figma setup
1. Duplicate the [Design Toolkit - Library](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1106540939095361694) to your team and publish the components so that the plugin can access them.
2. Install the [Inspector](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/760351147138040099/Inspector) plugin, to reference the unique `Key` for each component.
3. Run the Inspector plugin and identify the unique `Key` for the components in your version of "Design Toolkit - Library". You will need to update the keys in `main.ts` before the plugin will work.

## Installing the plugin
1. In the Figma desktop app, open a Figma document.
2. Search for and run Import plugin from manifest… via the Quick Actions search bar.
3. Select the `manifest.json` file that was generated by the build script.
4. The plugin will now be installed and available in the "Figma > Plugins > Development" menu. Don't launch it yet

## Run the plugin in Figma
The plugin can now be launched using either of these methods:
1. Figma > Plugins > Development > Design Toolkit
2. - Open the Quick Actions window using `Cmd + /` or `Ctrl + /` and type "Design Toolkit"

#### Note: If it stays on “Building template” for more than a few seconds with no changes, there has probably been an issue with one of the components. Check the troubleshooting below.

## Troubleshooting
If the plugin has an error, Harwood recommends checking the Console in Developer Tools in your browser for an error message. It could be that the font used in your component is not installed/available to your team.


## Publishing
When you're happy with your plugin, follow the instructions to publish it.
